# CRM-System
Customer Relationship Management System. 
Enables a company to manage their customer's information, add details of calls made by the customer to their own file and implement a diary
for all users of this system. This is a project I did while learning spring framework. 
Key skills practiced are: 
.Programming through interfaces .Singleton & Prototype beans .Dependency Injection .Configuration through xml 
.Resource Injection via Annotations .Aspect Oriented Programming .Proxy design pattern .Application Transactions
.SpEL .AspectJ pointcut syntax . Unit testing .Integration testing .JPA & Hibernate

Features:
1. Store details of customers. i.e. Customer's name, company name, email, phone, notes about customer and all the calls made by customer,
2. Every time a customer calls, we can record the details of the customerâ€™s call. i.e. Call date and time, notes about the call,
3. Once the call is logged, we can record one or more Actions against the call. i.e Action's owning user, action details, action deadline,
   status of action whether it was completed,
4. A diary for all of the users of the system with way to check all the pending actions and completed actions.
